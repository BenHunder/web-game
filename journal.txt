created cellMap class which consists of two data structures that hold the same cells.
It allows me to access cells by their letter (like it could before) and also access cells in relation to another cell. For example, cellMap.above(c) => d

started using the cellMap class
began testing cellMap methods and came across a tricky bug
I learned that if you use Array.fill(someObject) it will only pass a reference to the object into each slot of the array. So you have to be careful. It's probably not really supposed to be used with objects.
fixed the bug by replacing the nested Array.fill()s in the grid initialization with a nested for loop
I learned about circular references in objects when trying to use JSON.stringify() on cells. the traits classes contained a reference to their parent cells
I think I am not really using the traits how they are intended to be used (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rBOUyRGQuU&list=PLS8HfBXv9ZWWe8zXrViYbIM2Hhylx8DZx&index=4 @ 13:50) and they arent very intuitive
should probably rework the traits and fix the circular reference
thought about starting unit test cases. would help for the new cellMap code. but still don't think it is worth my time yet.
