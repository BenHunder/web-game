//do we need this? or do we just need to pass a function that returns a new creature or something. i am getting confused. this factory thing seems like a lot of unnecessary work

export class CreatureFactory{
    constructor(attributes){
        //TODO overall defaults go here?
        this.health = 20;

    }
}
